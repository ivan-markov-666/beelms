# my-lms

This project was bootstrapped using the experimental beelms core CLI prototype.

At this stage, the CLI only creates an empty folder with this README.
Future iterations will automatically scaffold:
- api/ (NestJS backend, based on the current be/ folder)
- web/ (optional Next.js frontend, based on the current fe/ folder)
- docker/ and env/ (Docker Compose + environment templates)

For the full manual template process, see:
docs/sprint-artifacts/beelms-core-ws-core-4-manual-template.md in the beelms core repo.
