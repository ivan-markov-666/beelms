# my-next-lms

This project was bootstrapped using the experimental beelms core CLI prototype.

The CLI currently scaffolds an initial beelms core structure based on the current repo:
- api/ (NestJS backend template, copied from the be/ folder)
- web/ (optional Next.js frontend template, copied from the fe/ folder)
- docker/ (Docker Compose file copied from docker-compose.yml)
- env/ (placeholder folder for environment templates)

For the full manual template process and how this maps to WS-CORE-1..3, see:
docs/sprint-artifacts/beelms-core-ws-core-4-manual-template.md in the beelms core repo.
